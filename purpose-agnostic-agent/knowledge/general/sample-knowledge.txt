# Sample Knowledge Base Document

This is a sample document for testing the RAG system.

## About NestJS

NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript by default and combines elements of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP), and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP).

Key features of NestJS:
- Built with TypeScript
- Modular architecture
- Dependency injection
- Decorators for clean code
- Built-in support for testing
- Microservices support
- GraphQL and REST API support

## About RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that combines information retrieval with text generation. It works by:

1. Retrieving relevant documents from a knowledge base
2. Using those documents as context for the language model
3. Generating responses based only on the retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Reduces hallucinations
- Provides source citations
- Enables domain-specific knowledge
- More cost-effective than fine-tuning

## About Vector Databases

Vector databases store data as high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that represent semantic meaning. They enable:

- Semantic search (finding similar concepts, not just keywords)
- Fast similarity search using algorithms like HNSW
- Efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings

Popular vector databases include:
- pgvector (PostgreSQL extension)
- Pinecone
- Weaviate
- Qdrant
- Milvus

## Testing Instructions

To test this knowledge base:

1. Ask: "What is NestJS?"
   Expected: Should return information about NestJS being a Node.js framework

2. Ask: "How does RAG work?"
   Expected: Should explain the RAG process with retrieval and generation

3. Ask: "What are vector databases?"
   Expected: Should describe vector databases and their use cases

4. Ask: "What is the capital of France?"
   Expected: Should respond with "I don't have enough information in my knowledge base"
   (This tests RAG-only behavior - the answer is not in this document)

Docker Basics

What is Docker?
Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers package software with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments.

Key Concepts:

1. Container:
A lightweight, standalone executable package that includes everything needed to run software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

2. Image:
A read-only template used to create containers. Images are built from a Dockerfile and can be stored in registries like Docker Hub.

3. Dockerfile:
A text file containing instructions to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, dependencies, and commands to run.

4. Docker Compose:
A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

Common Docker Commands:
- docker build: Build an image from a Dockerfile
- docker run: Create and start a container
- docker ps: List running containers
- docker stop: Stop a running container
- docker rm: Remove a container
- docker images: List available images
- docker pull: Download an image from a registry
- docker push: Upload an image to a registry

Benefits of Docker:
1. Consistency: Same environment across development, testing, and production
2. Isolation: Applications run in isolated containers
3. Portability: Containers can run anywhere Docker is installed
4. Efficiency: Containers share the host OS kernel, using fewer resources than VMs
5. Scalability: Easy to scale applications horizontally
6. Version Control: Images can be versioned and rolled back

Docker vs Virtual Machines:
- Containers share the host OS kernel (lightweight)
- VMs include a full OS (heavyweight)
- Containers start in seconds
- VMs take minutes to boot
- Containers use less disk space and memory

REST API Guide

What is a REST API?
A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data.

Key Principles of REST:
1. Client-Server Architecture: The client and server are separate, allowing them to evolve independently.
2. Stateless: Each request from client to server must contain all information needed to understand the request.
3. Cacheable: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.
4. Uniform Interface: Resources are identified in requests using URIs.
5. Layered System: Client cannot tell whether it's connected directly to the end server.

HTTP Methods in REST:
- GET: Retrieve data from the server
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT: Update existing resources
- DELETE: Remove resources
- PATCH: Partially update resources

Common Status Codes:
- 200 OK: Request succeeded
- 201 Created: Resource created successfully
- 400 Bad Request: Invalid request
- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required
- 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist
- 500 Internal Server Error: Server error

Best Practices:
1. Use nouns for resource names (e.g., /users, /products)
2. Use HTTP methods to define actions
3. Version your API (e.g., /api/v1/users)
4. Use proper status codes
5. Implement pagination for large datasets
6. Provide clear error messages
7. Use HTTPS for security
